0.2.0.0
=======
20070402 war

OK, thanks to Robert John I found a solution to accessing both Outlook 2003 and 2007.
By referencing a local copy of the 2003 COM-Wrapper both OL 2003 and 2007 can be 
accessed due to backward compatibility of OL 2007.
This justifies the version increase from 0.1 to 0.2

Changes:
1. Added local copy of Microsoft.Office.Interop.Outlook.dll and referenced it.


0.1.0.12
========
20070321 war

Changes:
1. Added a parameter to fMiCal.exe to accept profile names
2. Constructor of OLCalReader uses "Outlook" as default profile name. Accepts profile name override
3. Changed Calendar folder to Outlook profile and forward profile name as parameter to fMiCal.exe
4. Added error signaling to fMiCal.run. FreeMiCal interpretes a -1 as an error from fMiCal.


0.1.0.11
========
20070321 war

Internal version, not released on Sourceforge

Changes:
1. monitoring of fMiCal.run and update of the progress bar is done in a background worker process.
2. Export can be cancelled now, terminating the export process fMiCal.exe and the background worker process.
3. A feedback area above the progress bar provides error and status messages.
4. Lock situation is catched. FreeMiCal reacts generously to locked fMiCal.run.


0.1.0.10
========
20070316 war

Changes:
1. The graphical front end now provides visual feedback with a progress bar
2. In order to update this, fMiCal writes a file fMiCal.run. 
   FreeMiCal reads this file and updates the progress bar accordingly.
3. The Button Free them... will change to Liberte... (I did not implement Cancel yet)

Known issues:
1. A deadlock situation may occur when fMiCal writes the file when FreeMiCal tries to read. 
   I have tried to catch this, but there are situations where it still might arise.


0.1.0.9
=======
20070315 war

Internal version, not released on Sourceforge

Changes:
1. fMiCal.exe writes a sync file named fMiCal.run


0.1.0.8
=======
20070315 war

Changes:
1. Fixed shifted appointment times with daylight saving time


0.1.0.7
=======
20070311 war

Changes:
1. Fixed error in processing Sunday appointments
2. Added prototype graphical frontend FreeMiCal

0.1.0.6
=======
20070309 war

First release on SourceForge

Changes:
1. FreeMiCal.exe is the Windows version, fMiCal the command line version
2. It allows to set the parameters in a dialog and then fire up the export

Implementation:
1. FreeMiCal starts fMiCal with command line parameters assembled from the input fields.
2. fMiCal is started as a child process with hidden windows. I don't know how the Outlook dialog behaves.
 PLEASE CAN YOU TEST THIS ON VISTA?

Known issues:
1. If export takes longer, there is no feedback to the graphical front end. I am working on a solution
2. If you exit the Window, the hidden process terminates
3. If an error occurs while starting the sub process, the dialog just informs but no further reaction is programmed 

0.1.0.0 - 0.1.0.5

Internal versions for testing. Successor of Outlook2iCal
